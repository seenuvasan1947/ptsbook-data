Episode 1: Gathering at the Cheese Station C

In the opening part of  Who Moved My Cheese?  titled  Gathering at the Cheese Station C,  we are introduced to a simple yet profound allegory set in a maze. This allegory serves as a backdrop for exploring the human experience when facing change, adaptation, and the pursuit of happiness and success.

The story begins with the daily routine of four characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw. They all gather at Cheese Station C to enjoy the abundant cheese there, which symbolizes their personal success and happiness. Sniff and Scurry, being mice, represent the more instinctual and adaptable side of human nature. They have a no-nonsense approach, noticing the cheese's gradual depletion and promptly setting out to find more.

Hem and Haw, on the other hand, represent the human tendencies to become complacent and resist change. They have grown comfortable with their daily routine and believe the cheese will always be there for them.

This part of the book illustrates how different individuals respond to change, particularly when faced with the unexpected disappearance of their  cheese.  It serves as an introduction to the central theme of the book: change is inevitable, and how we deal with it impacts our success and happiness. It prompts readers to reflect on their own reactions to change and consider which character they might relate to most.
