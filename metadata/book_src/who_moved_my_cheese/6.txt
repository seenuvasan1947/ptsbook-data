In  Part 5: Enjoying New Cheese,  we witness the culmination of Haw's journey and the realization of the benefits of embracing change. This part of the book emphasizes the rewards that come from adapting to new circumstances and finding fresh sources of happiness and success.

Haw's persistence in exploring the maze pays off as he eventually discovers a new cheese source. Unlike his previous mindset of resistance and fear, he now approaches the new cheese with a sense of openness and gratitude. This transition illustrates the transformation that can occur when individuals embrace change and let go of old fears and habits.

Haw not only enjoys the new cheese but also takes time to reflect on his journey. He continues to leave messages on the walls of the maze, sharing his insights and experiences. These messages serve as a testament to the power of change and the importance of not getting stuck in one's comfort zone.
