ntroduction:

The introduction of  Who Moved My Cheese?  sets the stage for the parable by introducing the reader to the concept of change and its impact on individuals and organizations. It presents the maze as a metaphor for life and work, where people are constantly searching for their metaphorical  cheese,  which represents success, happiness, or desired outcomes.

The introduction establishes the four main characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw, who each represent different approaches to change. Sniff and Scurry are mice who adapt quickly and take action when their cheese disappears, while Hem and Haw are little people who initially resist change and are reluctant to leave their comfort zones.

Dr. Johnson invites the reader to embark on a journey with these characters to explore their responses to change and to gain insights into how to deal with change in their own lives.
