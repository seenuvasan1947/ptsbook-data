In Joseph Murphy's  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,  the exploration of the subconscious mind extends to interpersonal relationships. This episode delves into the fascinating topic of how you can use your subconscious mind to influence and arouse positive responses in others.

Key Points:

The Subconscious Influence: Your subconscious mind not only shapes your reality but also affects how others perceive and respond to you. Understanding this can help you navigate social interactions more effectively.

The Law of Attraction: The law of attraction suggests that like attracts like. When you radiate positive energy and thoughts, you tend to attract people who resonate with those qualities.

Positive Expectancy: Your subconscious mind can create an aura of positive expectancy around you. When you genuinely expect positive outcomes and interactions, others are more likely to respond positively to your presence.

Building Confidence: Confidence is magnetic. When you believe in yourself and your abilities, it radiates from you, drawing others towards you. Your subconscious plays a vital role in building and maintaining self-confidence.

Visualization: Visualization is a powerful technique for influencing others positively. By visualizing harmonious and successful interactions with individuals, you send out signals that can lead to the desired outcomes.

Affirmations for Relationship Building: Crafting positive affirmations related to your relationships can help shape your subconscious mind. Examples include,  I attract positive and supportive people into my life  or  My interactions with others are filled with respect and understanding. 

Empathy and Understanding: Empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings of others. Your subconscious mind can help you develop a deeper sense of empathy, which enhances your ability to connect with people on a meaningful level.

Effective Communication: Effective communication skills are essential for arousing positive responses in others. Your subconscious mind can assist in developing active listening, empathy, and clear expression.

Building Trust: Trust is the foundation of strong relationships. Your subconscious can help you build and maintain trust by aligning your thoughts, words, and actions with honesty and integrity.

Respect and Appreciation: Respect and appreciation for others are powerful forces for influencing positive responses. By cultivating these qualities within your subconscious mind, you can foster mutual respect and appreciation in your relationships.

Mindful Presence: Being fully present in your interactions with others is a subconscious practice. When you are genuinely engaged, attentive, and present, people respond positively to your undivided attention.

Avoid Manipulation: While you can use your subconscious mind to positively influence others, it's essential to do so with integrity and respect for their autonomy. Avoid manipulative tactics, as they can harm relationships.

Practice Patience: Positive influence often takes time. Be patient in your efforts to influence others through your subconscious mind, allowing relationships to develop naturally.

Authenticity: Authenticity is a key element of positive influence. Be yourself and let your subconscious mind project your true character, as authenticity fosters genuine connections.
