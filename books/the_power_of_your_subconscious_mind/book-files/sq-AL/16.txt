Episode 15: Scientists Use the Subconscious Mind

In  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind  by Joseph Murphy, the book explores various real-life examples and instances where scientists and researchers have harnessed the power of the subconscious mind to achieve remarkable discoveries and advancements. This episode focuses on how scientists have utilized the subconscious mind in their work and the implications of such utilization.

Key Points:

The Subconscious Mind's Role in Problem Solving: Scientists often face complex problems and challenges in their research. The subconscious mind is a valuable tool for problem-solving because it can work on a task even when the conscious mind is not actively engaged.

Thomas Edison's Example: Thomas Edison, one of the most prolific inventors in history, would use a technique called  sleep thinking  to find solutions to problems. He would hold a ball in his hand as he relaxed in a chair, and as he drifted off to sleep, his hand would release the ball, making a noise that woke him. In that semi-conscious state, he often found solutions to his scientific inquiries.

The Subconscious as a Creative Partner: Scientists and inventors have long recognized the power of the subconscious mind as a creative partner. They have learned to trust the subconscious to generate innovative ideas and solutions.

Innovations in Chemistry and Medicine: Numerous breakthroughs in chemistry and medicine have been attributed to insights that occurred in dreams or moments of deep relaxation. Discoveries of new compounds, medical treatments, and therapeutic methods have been inspired by the subconscious.

The Story of Elias Howe: Elias Howe, the inventor of the modern sewing machine, had a vivid dream in which he was surrounded by cannibals who brandished spears with holes in the tips. This dream led him to the idea of a needle with a hole near the tip, which revolutionized sewing technology.

Trusting Intuition: Many scientists have learned to trust their intuition and gut feelings, which often originate from the subconscious mind. These intuitive hunches can lead to significant scientific insights and discoveries.

Practical Applications: The book suggests that you can apply the same principles used by scientists to access your own subconscious creativity. By posing a question to your subconscious before sleep or during a relaxed state and trusting that the answer will come, you can tap into your subconscious problem-solving abilities.

Recording Dreams: Keeping a dream journal can be a helpful way to capture ideas and insights that emerge from your subconscious mind during sleep. It's a practice that has been used by artists, writers, and scientists alike.

Limitless Potential: The examples of scientists using the subconscious mind underscore the idea that our mental capacities are vast and often untapped. By acknowledging and utilizing the power of the subconscious, we can enhance our creativity, problem-solving abilities, and capacity for innovation.
