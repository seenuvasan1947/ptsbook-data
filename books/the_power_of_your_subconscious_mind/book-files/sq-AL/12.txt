Episode 11: How to Get the Results You Want

In  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind  by Joseph Murphy, the focus is on how to achieve the desired results in your life by effectively harnessing the power of your subconscious mind. Murphy provides practical guidance on how to utilize this power to bring about positive changes.

Key Points:

Clarity of Thought: Murphy emphasizes the importance of clarity in your thinking. To get the results you want, you must be clear about your goals and desires. Ambiguity or vagueness in your thoughts can lead to mixed outcomes.

Positive Affirmations: Affirmations are powerful tools for influencing the subconscious mind. Repeatedly affirm your desired outcome with faith and conviction. Murphy suggests using positive statements such as  I am healthy  or  I am successful  to program your mind for success.

Visualization: Visualization involves mentally picturing the achievement of your goals. Create detailed mental images of what you want to achieve, imagining the process and the emotions associated with success. The subconscious mind responds strongly to vivid mental images.

Emotion and Feeling: Feelings and emotions are crucial when working with the subconscious mind. You must genuinely feel and believe in the reality of your desired outcome. Emotional engagement strengthens the impact of your thoughts and affirmations.

Persistent Belief: Developing and maintaining a strong belief in the attainment of your goals is essential. Doubt and skepticism can counteract the power of your subconscious mind. Trust that your mind is working to bring about your desired results.

Patience and Persistence: Achieving significant results may take time. Be patient and persistent in your efforts. Continue to reinforce positive thoughts and affirmations, even if you don't see immediate changes.

Conscious and Subconscious Harmony: Your conscious and subconscious minds should be in harmony. Avoid sending mixed messages by aligning your thoughts, beliefs, and desires with your conscious mind. Avoid negative self-talk or contradictory thoughts.

Avoid Negative Influences: Be cautious about the people and information you expose yourself to. Negative influences can impact your subconscious mind and hinder your progress. Surround yourself with positivity and inspiration.

Expectancy and Gratitude: Maintain a sense of expectancy and gratitude for the results you are working toward. Expectancy keeps your mind focused on the goal, while gratitude reinforces positive emotions.

Regular Review: Regularly review your goals and affirmations. This helps keep your focus sharp and ensures that your subconscious is continually working towards your desired results.

By following these principles and techniques, you can effectively harness the power of your subconscious mind to bring about the results you want in your life. Clarity, positivity, belief, and persistence are key elements in this process. Your subconscious mind is a powerful ally in achieving your goals when used correctly.
