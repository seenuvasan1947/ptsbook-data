Episode 28: How to Use Your Subconscious Mind to Get and Stay Well

In  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind  by Joseph Murphy, the book emphasizes the remarkable connection between your subconscious mind and your physical health. This episode explores how you can tap into the power of your subconscious to promote well-being, heal your body, and maintain good health.

Key Points:

Mind-Body Connection: Your thoughts and beliefs have a profound impact on your physical health. The mind-body connection is a fundamental principle that underscores the role of the subconscious mind in maintaining well-being.

Belief in Healing: Your subconscious mind responds to your beliefs about health and illness. If you hold strong beliefs in your body's ability to heal, you're more likely to experience positive health outcomes.

Placebo Effect: The placebo effect is a prime example of the power of belief. When individuals believe they are receiving treatment, even if it's a sugar pill, their bodies often respond positively, demonstrating the influence of the mind on physical health.

Negative Beliefs and Health: Conversely, negative beliefs and thoughts can harm your health. Worry, stress, and fear can weaken the immune system and lead to various health issues.

Positive Affirmations: Using positive affirmations related to health and well-being can reprogram your subconscious mind. Repeating affirmations such as  I am healthy and strong  can have a beneficial impact on your physical health.

Visualize Health: Visualization is a potent tool to engage your subconscious mind in promoting wellness. Visualize yourself in a state of perfect health, imagining every aspect of your body functioning optimally.

Mental Healing: Dr. Murphy advocates the use of mental healing techniques. By mentally affirming health and well-being, you stimulate the natural healing processes of your body.

Avoid Negative Language: Eliminate negative language related to illness and health from your vocabulary. Instead of saying,  I'm always getting sick,  shift to a positive statement like,  I am resilient and rarely get sick. 

Affirmation Examples: Create personalized health affirmations that address specific concerns. For example, if you're working on weight loss, you can affirm,  I am easily maintaining my ideal weight. 

Emotional Health: Recognize the impact of emotions on physical health. Unresolved emotional issues can manifest as physical symptoms. Address emotional well-being to support physical health.

Relaxation Techniques: Practice relaxation techniques like meditation and deep breathing to reduce stress and promote a state of calm. Stress reduction is crucial for maintaining good health.

Holistic Approach: Adopt a holistic approach to health, considering not only physical but also mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects. Balance in all these areas contributes to overall well-being.

Nutrition and Exercise: Nourish your body with a balanced diet and regular exercise. These physical practices also influence your mental and emotional states, contributing to overall health.

Belief in Full Recovery: If you're dealing with an illness or injury, maintain a strong belief in your body's ability to recover fully. Your mindset plays a significant role in the healing process.
