Episode 32: How to Use Your Subconscious Mind for Writing

Joseph Murphy's  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind  teaches us how to harness the potential of our subconscious mind to achieve our goals. In this episode, we'll explore how writers and aspiring authors can tap into their subconscious mind to enhance creativity, overcome writer's block, and produce compelling content.

Key Points:

The Creative Power of the Subconscious Mind: Your subconscious mind is a wellspring of creativity. It holds the potential to generate fresh ideas, solve problems, and produce innovative writing.

The Role of Belief: To access your subconscious mind's creative power, you must first believe in its capabilities. Nurture a strong belief that your subconscious mind can assist you in your writing endeavors.

Setting Clear Intentions: Before beginning a writing session, set clear intentions and goals for what you want to achieve. Your subconscious mind responds better when it has a specific target.

Relaxation and Visualization: Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and meditation to calm your conscious mind. In a relaxed state, visualize yourself effortlessly writing and enjoying the creative process.

Affirmations for Writers: Develop positive affirmations related to your writing goals. Examples include,  I am a prolific and creative writer,  or  Writing comes to me easily and naturally. 

Morning and Night Affirmations: Repeat your writing affirmations both in the morning and before bedtime. This programs your subconscious mind to focus on your writing objectives throughout the day.

The Writing Process: When faced with writer's block or a challenging writing task, turn to your subconscious mind for guidance. Before sleep, pose a question or problem related to your writing, trusting that your subconscious will provide solutions.

Dream Journaling: Keep a journal by your bedside to record any ideas, solutions, or inspiration that come to you in dreams. Often, the subconscious mind communicates through dreams.

Automatic Writing: Try automatic writing as a technique to bypass conscious thought and allow your subconscious to flow freely onto the page. Set a timer, put pen to paper, and write without self-censorship.

Silencing Self-Doubt: Banish self-doubt and negative self-talk from your writing process. Replace these thoughts with affirmations of your capabilities and worthiness as a writer.

Consistency: Writing regularly helps keep your subconscious mind engaged in the creative process. Make it a habit to write at the same time and in the same place if possible.

The Subconscious Editing Process: Your subconscious mind can also aid in the editing process. After completing a piece of writing, allow it to rest. Upon returning to it, trust your subconscious to highlight areas that need improvement.

Listening to Intuition: Pay attention to intuitive nudges and hunches during your writing. Your subconscious often communicates through intuition, guiding you toward the right words or plot developments.

Writer's Block Solutions: If you encounter writer's block, take a break, engage in a relaxing activity, or pose a question to your subconscious before sleep. Often, the blockage will dissolve as your subconscious continues to work on the problem.
