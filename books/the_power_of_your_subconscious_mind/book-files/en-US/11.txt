Episode 10: The Tendency of the Subconscious Is Lifeward

In this section of Joseph Murphy's  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,  the author delves into the inherent nature of the subconscious mind, emphasizing its natural inclination towards life and growth. Understanding this tendency can help individuals harness the power of their subconscious minds to lead more fulfilling lives.

Key Points:

The Subconscious Mind as a Servant: Murphy reiterates that your subconscious mind is like a faithful servant. It takes your beliefs, thoughts, and desires as commands and works diligently to make them a reality. However, it doesn't question whether these commands are positive or negative; it simply follows your lead.

The Lifeward Tendency: Murphy asserts that the subconscious mind has a lifeward, constructive, and creative tendency. It always seeks to improve your life, promote well-being, and help you overcome challenges. When you align your thoughts and beliefs with positive outcomes, you allow your subconscious to work in your favor.

Overcoming Negative Conditioning: Despite its lifeward inclination, your subconscious can be heavily influenced by negative conditioning from external sources or past experiences. Murphy advises that you can recondition your subconscious by consistently feeding it positive thoughts and beliefs. This reprogramming can overwrite any negative programming from the past.

How to Utilize the Lifeward Tendency: To harness the lifeward tendency of your subconscious mind, Murphy recommends adopting practices such as daily affirmations and visualization. These techniques help you communicate your desires clearly to your subconscious and instill positive beliefs about your goals.

The Role of Faith: Faith plays a significant role in activating the lifeward tendency of your subconscious. Believing in the possibility of your goals and trusting your subconscious mind to work towards them is crucial. Doubt and disbelief can hinder your progress.

Avoiding Negative Suggestions: Murphy warns against accepting negative suggestions from others or dwelling on pessimistic thoughts. These can counteract the lifeward tendency of your subconscious. Instead, consciously choose to focus on positive and constructive ideas.

The Power of Your Self-Image: Your self-image plays a pivotal role in activating the lifeward tendency. If you see yourself as successful, happy, and healthy, your subconscious will strive to manifest these qualities in your life.
