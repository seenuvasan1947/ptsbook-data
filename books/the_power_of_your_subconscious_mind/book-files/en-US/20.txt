Episode 19: How Your Subconscious Mind Removes Mental Blocks

In  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind  by Joseph Murphy, the author emphasizes the role of the subconscious mind in removing mental blocks and limitations that hinder personal growth and success. This episode explores the techniques and principles outlined in the book to help you unlock your subconscious mind's potential in removing mental obstacles.

Key Points:

Identifying Mental Blocks: Mental blocks are self-imposed limitations that can prevent you from achieving your goals and realizing your potential. They often stem from past experiences, self-doubt, or negative beliefs.

The Power of Your Subconscious Mind: Your subconscious mind is a reservoir of immense power and potential. It operates beneath your conscious awareness and can either reinforce or eliminate mental blocks.

Positive Affirmations: Affirmations are positive statements that you repeat to yourself to reprogram your subconscious mind. Create affirmations that counteract your specific mental blocks. For example, if you doubt your abilities, affirm,  I am confident and capable in all that I do. 

Visualization: Visualization is a technique that involves vividly imagining your desired outcomes. By consistently visualizing success and overcoming obstacles, you train your subconscious mind to remove mental blocks and work towards your goals.

Release Negative Emotions: Unresolved negative emotions, such as fear or anger, can create mental blocks. To remove these blocks, acknowledge and express these emotions in a healthy way. This process can free your subconscious from their influence.

The Law of Substitution: The subconscious mind cannot hold two conflicting beliefs simultaneously. Use this principle to your advantage by substituting negative thoughts or beliefs with positive ones. When a mental block arises, replace it with a more constructive belief.

Auto-Suggestion: Repeating positive affirmations and statements of empowerment regularly through auto-suggestion can create a powerful change in your subconscious mind. The repetition reinforces new thought patterns and gradually removes mental blocks.

Visual Cues: Surround yourself with visual cues that represent your goals and desires. These reminders can help your subconscious mind focus on what you want to achieve and gradually dissolve mental obstacles.

Hypnosis and Meditation: Hypnosis and meditation can be effective tools for accessing the subconscious mind and addressing deep-seated mental blocks. Guided sessions or self-hypnosis techniques can help you work on specific issues.

Self-Analysis: Regular self-analysis can reveal hidden beliefs and thought patterns that contribute to mental blocks. Journaling or seeking the assistance of a therapist can aid in uncovering and addressing these underlying issues.

Persistence and Patience: Removing mental blocks is a process that requires persistence and patience. Be consistent in your efforts to reprogram your subconscious mind and trust that change will occur over time.

Affirmations for Self-Confidence: If your mental blocks are rooted in self-doubt, create affirmations that boost your self-confidence. Embrace your unique abilities and talents, and affirm your worthiness of success.
