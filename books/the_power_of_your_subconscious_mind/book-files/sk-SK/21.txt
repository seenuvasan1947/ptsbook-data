Episode 20: How to Use Your Subconscious Mind to Remove Fear

Fear can be a paralyzing emotion that holds you back from achieving your goals and living a fulfilling life. In  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind  by Joseph Murphy, you'll discover how to tap into the potential of your subconscious mind to remove fear and regain control over your life. This episode delves into practical techniques to overcome fear and lead a more confident and fearless life.

Key Points:

Understanding Fear: Fear is a natural response to perceived threats or challenges. However, excessive fear can become a mental block, hindering personal growth and success.

Recognizing Fear's Impact: Fear can manifest in various ways, such as anxiety, self-doubt, procrastination, or avoidance. Identifying how fear affects you personally is the first step to overcoming it.

The Subconscious Mind and Fear: Your subconscious mind plays a crucial role in perpetuating or eliminating fear. It can reinforce fearful thoughts and behaviors, but it can also be reprogrammed to remove fear.

Positive Affirmations: Create affirmations that counteract your specific fears. For instance, if you fear failure, affirm,  I am capable of handling any situation, and I learn and grow from every experience. 

Visualize Fearlessness: Regularly visualize yourself facing and conquering the sources of your fear. Imagine a scenario where you feel completely fearless and confident. This practice rewires your subconscious to associate fear with courage and success.

Auto-Suggestion: Repetition is key to ingraining new beliefs in your subconscious mind. Use auto-suggestion to repeat your affirmations and visualize a fearless version of yourself regularly.

The Law of Substitution: Replace fearful thoughts with positive, empowering ones whenever they arise. The subconscious mind cannot hold conflicting beliefs, so choose to focus on thoughts that serve your goals and aspirations.

Gradual Exposure: If your fear is related to a specific situation or object, consider gradual exposure. Slowly expose yourself to what you fear in a controlled and safe manner, desensitizing your subconscious to the fear response.

Meditation and Relaxation: Practicing meditation and relaxation techniques can help calm the mind and reduce fear and anxiety. Regular meditation sessions allow you to access your subconscious mind more effectively.

Seek Professional Help: If your fear is deeply rooted or significantly impacts your life, consider seeking the assistance of a therapist or counselor. They can provide valuable guidance and techniques to address fear and its underlying causes.

Fear as a Motivator: Use fear as a motivator rather than a hindrance. Fear can sometimes push you to take necessary action and make positive changes in your life.

Celebrate Small Wins: As you gradually overcome fear, celebrate your small victories. Acknowledging your progress reinforces positive changes in your subconscious mind.

Patience and Persistence: Removing fear from your subconscious mind is a process that requires patience and persistence. Be kind to yourself and recognize that change may take time.
