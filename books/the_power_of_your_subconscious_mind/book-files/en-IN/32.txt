Episode 31: How to Use Your Subconscious Mind to Remove Worry

In Joseph Murphy's  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,  the author explores the incredible potential of the subconscious mind in transforming our lives. In this episode, we'll focus on how you can use your subconscious mind to remove worry, reduce stress, and achieve a more peaceful and fulfilling existence.

Key Points:

Understanding Worry: Worry is a mental state characterized by fear, anxiety, and unease about the future. Excessive worry can lead to stress, health problems, and a reduced quality of life.

The Subconscious Mind and Worry: Your subconscious mind is highly receptive to the thoughts and emotions you consistently feed it. When you worry incessantly, your subconscious mind accepts these worries as reality and works to manifest them.

Replacing Worry with Positive Thoughts: To combat worry, replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations and thoughts. Whenever a worry surfaces, consciously replace it with a constructive and optimistic belief.

Affirmations for Worry: Create powerful affirmations such as,  I release all worries and embrace peace,  or  I trust in the process of life, and everything unfolds perfectly. 

Visualization: Practice visualization techniques where you see yourself calmly handling situations that once caused worry. Visualizing positive outcomes can reprogram your subconscious mind.

Meditation and Relaxation: Engage in meditation and relaxation practices to calm your conscious mind. A relaxed state of mind is more receptive to positive suggestions for your subconscious.

Deep Breathing: Deep breathing exercises can reduce stress and anxiety. When you're relaxed physically, your mind is more open to positive mental conditioning.

Focus on the Present: Much worry arises from dwelling on the past or fearing the future. Train your mind to focus on the present moment, as this is where you have the most control.

Take Action: If there's a legitimate concern, take action to address it. Constructive action can dispel worry and replace it with a sense of empowerment.

Limit Exposure to Negative Information: Be mindful of the media and information you consume. Limit exposure to negative news and focus on uplifting and educational content.

The Law of Substitution: Murphy introduces the Law of Substitution, which suggests that you can replace a negative thought with a positive one. This principle reinforces the idea that you have control over your mental state.

Affirmations for Peace: Create affirmations that resonate with you personally. Examples include,  I am at peace with myself and the world,  or  I release all worries and embrace serenity. 

Consistency and Repetition: Repeating positive affirmations and practicing relaxation techniques consistently is essential to reprogramming your subconscious mind.

Seek Support: Sometimes, it's helpful to discuss your worries with a trusted friend or therapist. Sharing your concerns can alleviate their emotional impact.
