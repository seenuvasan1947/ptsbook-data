Episode 36: How to Use Your Subconscious Mind for Decision

Joseph Murphy's  The Power of Your Subconscious Mind  explores how you can tap into the incredible potential of your subconscious mind to make better decisions and lead a more fulfilling life. In this episode, we'll delve into the process of using your subconscious mind to enhance your decision-making abilities.

Key Points:

The Subconscious Decision-Maker: Your subconscious mind is a powerful decision-maker. It processes vast amounts of information and taps into your intuition and wisdom to help you make choices.

The Three-Step Process: Dr. Murphy outlines a simple three-step process to harness your subconscious mind for better decision-making:

a. Define the Decision: Clearly and precisely define the decision you need to make. Write it down to make it concrete and specific.

b. Assume the Decision Is Made: Imagine that the decision is already made in the affirmative. Feel the emotions associated with this decision being the right one.

c. Surrender to the Subconscious: Let go of conscious, anxious thought about the decision. Trust your subconscious to provide you with the correct answer in its own time.

Trust and Faith: Develop trust and faith in your subconscious mind's ability to guide you. Belief in your inner wisdom is crucial for this process to work effectively.

Avoid Rushed Decisions: Impulsive decisions made under pressure or stress are often regrettable. Use this technique when you have time to deliberate, and when the stakes are not too high.

Positive Affirmations: Use positive affirmations to program your subconscious mind. For example, say,  I am a great decision-maker. I trust my inner wisdom. 

Quiet Your Mind: Practice relaxation techniques, meditation, or mindfulness to quiet your conscious mind. A calm mind is more receptive to the wisdom of the subconscious.

Dreams and Insights: Pay attention to your dreams and any sudden insights that come to you. Sometimes, your subconscious communicates important decisions through these channels.

Maintain a Decision Journal: Keep a journal of the decisions you've made using this process and the outcomes. Reflect on how trusting your subconscious has benefited you.

Learn from Mistakes: If you feel you've made a wrong decision, don't dwell on it. Instead, view it as a learning experience and trust that your subconscious will help you make better decisions in the future.

Daily Practice: Make decision-making with your subconscious a daily practice. The more you do it, the more you'll strengthen your intuitive decision-making abilities.
