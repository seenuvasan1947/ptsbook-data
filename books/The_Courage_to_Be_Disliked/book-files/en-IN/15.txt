Episode 14: The Illusion of Competition and Success

In this episode, we explore the illusion of competition and the traditional notions of success. The book challenges the belief that life is a zero-sum game where success comes at the expense of others. Instead, it proposes that individuals can redefine success in ways that align with their own values and desires, rather than conforming to external standards. This episode delves into the concept of competition as a social construct and discusses the liberating idea that one can achieve success by their own definition without comparison to others.
