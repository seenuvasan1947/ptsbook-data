Episode 4: The Fiction of  Life Tasks  and  Life Tasks of Others 

In this episode, we confront the concept of  life tasks,  which are often imagined obligations or expectations imposed upon us by society, family, or culture. Adlerians argue that the notion of  life tasks  is a fictional construct. People often feel burdened by the perceived duty to fulfill these imaginary tasks. However, Adlerian psychology encourages individuals to question and challenge these external expectations, recognizing that they are not genuine obligations but rather societal constructs. This liberating perspective empowers individuals to define their own paths and values independently of external pressures.
