Episode 2: The Desire for Recognition and Social Interest

Recognition and social interest are fundamental aspects of human nature explored in Adlerian psychology. This episode delves into the concept that people seek recognition and approval from others, and this desire for social interest shapes our behavior. Adlerians believe that fostering genuine social interest—concern for the well-being of others—is key to healthy relationships and personal growth. This discussion offers insights into how we can balance our need for recognition with a broader concern for the welfare of our communities.
