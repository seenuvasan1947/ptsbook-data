Episode 16: The Concept of 'Being Liked'

In this episode, we explore the concept of 'being liked' and the importance people often place on seeking approval and validation from others. The book challenges the notion that one must constantly seek external validation and approval to be happy. Adlerian psychology emphasizes the significance of self-acceptance and self-validation over the desire for external recognition. This episode delves into the idea of finding intrinsic value and self-worth, rather than relying on the opinions of others. It encourages readers to shift their focus from 'being liked' to 'liking themselves.'
