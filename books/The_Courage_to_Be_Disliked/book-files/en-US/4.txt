Episode 3: The Separation of Tasks and Goals

One of the fundamental ideas in Adlerian psychology is the separation of tasks and goals. This episode explores how Adlerians view tasks as the responsibilities and actions that we must undertake in our daily lives. These tasks are distinct from our goals, which are our personal aspirations and desires. Understanding this separation allows individuals to approach tasks with a sense of purpose and accomplishment, without becoming overly fixated on the attainment of specific goals. It encourages a focus on the process and the journey rather than fixating solely on the destination.
