Episode 6: Past Trauma and Present Behavior

In this episode, we explore the connection between past trauma and present behavior. Adlerian psychology suggests that our past experiences can shape our behavior and perceptions of the present. However, it also emphasizes that individuals have the power to reinterpret their past and change their responses to present circumstances. This episode discusses how understanding the impact of past trauma and choosing to approach life differently can lead to personal growth, healing, and a happier life.
